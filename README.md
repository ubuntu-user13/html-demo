hi

Hello!! :)

The box file is .txt right now. When you create new files you'll want to add the correct file type. For an html file you'll want to make the name box.html. Right now I don't see a file type and when I DL'd it my computer auto-gave it a .txt. I was able to rename it with .html and open it and I added a screenshot of what I see on my end.
