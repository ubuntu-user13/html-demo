hi

Hello!! :)

The box file is .txt right now. When you create new files you'll want to add the correct file type. For an html file you'll want to make the name box.html. Right now I don't see a file type and when I DL'd it my computer auto-gave it a .txt. I was able to rename it with .html and open it and I added a screenshot of what I see on my end.


`padding: 20px; border-radius: 10px;` 

This part right now is in the place where it literally shows up as writing inside of the box. I think you meant for these to be attributes of the box rather than text inside of the box. You'll want to move this part so it becomes an attribute and not a string literal.
